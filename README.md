## Contributing
> Please **DO NOT** open a pull request for translations.<br>
> We use [Crowdin](https://translate.mutils.net) to manage translations!

To contribute to translations, just open the Crowdin project and click on any open project.
There you can choose your language and receive missing translations to fill in.

**Please do not just copy the auto translation!**<br>
Sometimes they work but most of the time they don't fit the Minecraft context.

### General Slang & Conventions
- Translations containing a ``<br>`` tag are multiline. Each line should not exceed about 35 characters.
- Minecraft context should stick to the ingame translation. Like items, blocks, commands, etc.

### Strict Conventions
`=` same as english source<br>
`*` can be anything / no strict translation
